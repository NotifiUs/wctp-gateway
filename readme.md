## About WCTP Gateway

WCTP Gateway is a web application that implements the Carrier Gateway WCTP Actor roles needed to interface with the [Amtelco](https://amtelco.com) WCTP Intelligent Series SMS Aggregator interface.

Ardently crafted for the Amtelco and [NAEO](https://www.naeo.org) community, you can use this application to run an Amtelco-compatible primary or backup SMS aggregator service using your own [Twilio](https://twilio.com) and [ThinQ](https://thinq.com) accounts &mdash; just bring your API keys!

The modern WCTP engine brings the following features and more:

- Create and manage Enterprise Host credentials
- Bring your own Twilio or ThinQ accounts
- Support for using Twilio Messaging Services or Phone Numbers
- Carrier priority and automatic fail-over
- TLS/SSL required by default

**Coming Soon**
- Sticky sending by recipient to favor specific carriers
- IP Whitelisting, MFA, and login notifications

## Status

We're actively testing with customers! Version 1.0.0 coming soon!

## Requirements

We use application, language, and OS features that require the following tools and technologies:

- **Ubuntu** linux
- **PHP 7.3+** for web application scripting
- **nginx with php-fpm** for web server
- **redis-server** for caching/queue
- **mysql** for storage
- **supervisord** to watch queue processes

We utilize linux specific methods of obtaining data about the hardware/server (such as memory, disk space, CPU, etc.)
Because of this, we require the use of a linux host. We generally recommend Ubuntu for most users. 

## Technologies

WCTP Gateway is a [Laravel](https://laravel.com) web-application that implements a WCTP endpoint and administrative portal. 
This system cannot send SMS messages without a supported carrier (Telecom API provider) like Twilio or ThinQ. 

### Front End
The web portal UI is built on [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) with some [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) sprinkled in.
We use [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) free for icons throughout the application. 
For various splash pages (errors, etc), we use open source illustrations from [UnDraw](https://undraw.co/illustrations).


### Laravel Application
You can setup and run Laravel in a wide-variety of environments, including Digital Ocean, Amazon, Azure, and just about any modern PHP web environment. 
Start from a single-server appliance setup and grow into a full blown load balancing and clustering setup.

Laravel [Forge](https://forge.laravel.com) is an easy to use server management tool to try out! 

You can also go *serverless*, and try out [Vapor](https://vapor.laravel.com/).
